# How to play?
1. Use WASD to move the Player around.
2. Left-click to attack.
3. Press F to dash.
4. Press Escape to pause the game.
5. If the Enemy is hit by the Player, the Enemy will enter the Mind Control state under these conditions:
   - The minimum effect of Mind Control is that the Enemy will no longer attack or chase the Player, but will instead automatically attack other Enemy AI for 10 seconds.
   - After 10 seconds, the Enemy AI will break free from the Mind Control effect, triggering a sound effect and displaying a "You Win" popup.

# Enjoy! :)
